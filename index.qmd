Hello!

My name is Etienne Compérat, and I am currently a second-year student in the [Economic Research Master's program](https://www.sciencespo.fr/ecole-recherche/en/academics/masters/master-economics/) at Sciences Po Paris. Willing to pursue in economic research, I created this website to effectively showcase my work, skills, and future projects.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Political and Social Sciences from Sciences Po, with a major in Economics and a minor in Central and Eastern European Studies. Additionally, I spent a year on exchange at the University of California, Berkeley, where I pursued studies in Environmental and Economic Policies. My primary research interests lie in Political Economy, Economic History, and Spatial Economics.

A special thanks to Paulo for his invaluable help in bringing this website to life! (You can find his Research Portfolio Tutorial [here](https://www.paulogcd.com/portfolio_tutorial/).)
