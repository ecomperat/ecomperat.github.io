[This website is a work in progress...]

Hello, I am Etienne Comp√©rat, currently a second year student of the [Economic Research Master](https://www.sciencespo.fr/ecole-recherche/en/academics/masters/master-economics/) at Sciences Po Paris. I am willing to pursue in Economic research, hence the goal of this website is to allow me to present efficiently my work so far, skills and projects for the future.


I have a Bachelor degree in Political and Social Sciences from Sciences Po with the Economics major and a minor in Central and Eastern European Studies. I have also done an exchange year at the University of California on the Berkeley campus where I have followed the Environmental and Economics Policies major. My research interest are political economy, spatial economy and economic history.
